After riding on the R5, I can definitely say that they are very comfortable, stiff, and super easy to get in and out of them with the BOA clips.Regarding size, I measured the length of my feet and added a little more to ensure I had some toe room and cross-checked against Fisik's sizing chart. Although they looked very skinny out of the box, my sweet slid in amazingly easy and my first 30mile ride was the most comfortable one I've ever had, even for my Flinstone-esque wide feet.

Competitive Cyclist was helpful with the return process, but in order to expedite an exchange, I purchased another pair in 45.5 to see if they fit. Well they do, but I'm a little frustrated because this time, while they fit, there were obvious indentations and cleat marks worn into the outer sole.

The Boa closure is the nicest closure that I've felt in a cycling shoe, it snugs down evenly over the top of the foot and without any pinch points. On the road, it's really easy to tighten or loosen as necessary with just a few clicks of the adjustment knob. These shoes seem to run a size or two smaller than normal shoes. I have a pair of Specialized mountain biking shoes in a size 42, which seem to fit true to size, and with the Fi'zi:k, I had to go to a 44 for proper fitment, which was perfect for the width, but a bit long for my liking.According to Fi'zi:k, the R5B is a bit heavier (25g) and not quite as high tech compared to the R3B. However, the R3B cost is a lot higher so you'll have to decide if the weight advantage is worth the additional cost.My main reason for going with these is the Boa closure, I tried on other shoes with velcro straps and none felt as good as the Boa system.

shoes are THE BOMB. I've worn Pearls for as long as I can remember and they keep getting better. I ran my first half marathon in a pair of TRAIL Izumi's. They are that versatile. Great design, great arch support. If you have a narrow foot like mine then this is a great shoe for you. Built tough for serious rock and wood knocks, I cannot recommend a better pair of shoes. Newtons: too unstable on the trail. Asics: Too much sole. Hoka: WAY too much sole and way too trendy (don't get caught in theh Hoka trap - it will wreck your running style forever).Stick with Pearl Izumi.

Also I've found them as being much heavier than expected and almost clunky. I think if you were to wear them just to kick about and for fashion they would suit the purpose, but any serious walking or jogging you'd be disappointed.

Added bonus is that they gave you 2 color laces: black and white so you can decide on person preference.Boyfriend wears these as his everyday shoes when he is hanging out. He does not play sports on them so cannot comment on how they perform when playing sports.I gave these 4 stars because there were minor scuff marks on the back of shoe on heel section (you would have to look up close to see them) on both shoes. I like things to be pristine when buying new. Also, I knew these were not leather so I cannot comment on how they do when they are wet.At the price purchased, I would definitely buy again.

I have, however, found how to eliminate the noise.. The Croc logo on the bottom is the cause. It creates a suction to the floor so as you walk and lift your foot it breaks the section and makes the popping/ click sound. I take a sharp knife and cut a groove from the edge of the logo to the side of the shoe on both sides. This prevents it from suctioning to the floor. Result : Quiet as a mouse.
